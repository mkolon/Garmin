python garmin_merge_tool.py Activities.csv cleaned_garmin_activities.sqlite


⚙️ What It Does

    Cleans and standardizes the new Garmin CSV file

    Loads existing data from a SQLite database (or creates it if missing)

    Merges the new data, avoiding duplicates based on date + activity_type + title

    Saves everything back to the same database

    Reports how many new records were added
    
    You have several strong options for querying and analyzing the database, depending on how hands-on or automated you'd like to be. Here's a breakdown:

---

### 🧠 **Option 1: Feed It Back to Me**
**Best for**: High-level analysis, trends, summaries, comparisons  
**How**:
- Upload the updated `.sqlite` file here
- Ask natural-language questions like:
  - “What was my average heart rate during backcountry skiing this winter?”
  - “Which month had the most calories burned?”
  - “Chart distance over time for cycling activities”

📌 *I can write SQL under the hood and even generate plots or export CSVs.*

---

### 🖥️ **Option 2: Use SQLite Locally**
**Best for**: Direct SQL querying on your machine  
Use tools like:
- **[DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)** — Easy GUI for viewing, querying, and exporting
- **Python + Pandas**:
  ```python
  import sqlite3
  import pandas as pd

  conn = sqlite3.connect("cleaned_garmin_activities.sqlite")
  df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM activities WHERE activity_type = 'Cycling'", conn)
  print(df.describe())
  ```
- **DataGrip**, **DBeaver**, or **VS Code** with SQLite extensions

---

### 📊 **Option 3: Connect to BI Tools**
**Best for**: Dashboards, recurring reports, visuals  
- Connect `.sqlite` file to:
  - **Tableau** or **Power BI**
  - **Google Data Studio** (via CSV exports or an intermediary)
  - **Excel** via Power Query
- Build dynamic filters (e.g., by activity type, season, duration)

---

### 🧩 Hybrid Option
You can do basic filtering and selection locally, then feed summaries or targeted data subsets back here for deeper analysis or interpretation.
