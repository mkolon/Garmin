To resume seamlessly later, here are the best practices for picking up where you left off:
✅ 1. Bookmark or Note These Key Elements

Save the following details somewhere:

    Your current SQLite database filename (e.g. garmin_activities.sqlite)

    Your current Python merge script filename (e.g. garmin_merge.py)

    Your intended canonical activity types list (e.g. running, cycling, walking, rowing, backcountry skiing, etc.)

    This summary goal:

        Normalize incoming Garmin activity types to a small set of approved values, using other for the rest, while preserving original titles.

✅ 2. Keep Your Files

Ensure you retain:

    The latest .sqlite database file you’re using

    The Python merge script as last downloaded

    A representative .csv file exported from Garmin for future testing

If possible, keep them all in a dedicated folder so you can upload them quickly.
✅ 3. When You Return: Tell Me

When you’re ready to resume, just start a new conversation and tell me something like:

    “I want to pick up on normalizing activity types in my Garmin merge script. Here's the script and database I'm using.”

Then upload:

    Your .sqlite file

    Your current garmin_merge.py script

I'll immediately understand and can regenerate the context from those.
